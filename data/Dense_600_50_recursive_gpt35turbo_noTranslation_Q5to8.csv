The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, manufactured by Olympus, has been implicated in superbug outbreaks due to a modification in the elevator channel that was intended to make the device safer. However, the modification did not prevent infection. The FDA is asking Olympus and other manufacturers to provide evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned, but so far the data submitted has not met the FDA's disinfection standard. The FDA has not yet decided if Olympus will be penalized for selling the device without permission. The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the healthcare community, and efforts are being made to develop additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with duodenoscope procedures.",0.4,0.5,0.44203833081613464,multi_context
