What is the role of probate judges in the same-sex marriage issue in Alabama?,"The role of probate judges in the same-sex marriage issue in Alabama is to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages, as ordered by the Alabama Supreme Court.","['(CNN)The Alabama Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages. In February, a federal court decision in Mobile County had cleared the path for same-sex marriages to begin in the state. The 134-page order Wednesday was supported by six justices. One dissented and another concurred to most of the opinion and in total to the result. Past and present clash over same-sex marriage in Deep South . Marriage is between one man and one woman under Alabama law, the order states. ""Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty,"" it says. Probate judges have five business days to respond to the order if they don\'t think they are bound to uphold it. ""Same-sex couples in #Alabama should not lose hope because of out-of-step Supreme Court ruling; #marriage fight is far from over.\n\n#ALMarriage,"" tweeted Equality Alabama. The Liberty Counsel, which filed an emergency petition to the state\'s Supreme Court said on its website that ""the ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court offers the most forceful and clearly articulated rebuttal to date of the imaginative arguments for same-sex ""marriage"" employed by federal courts."" In his dissent, Justice Greg Shaw wrote that he didn\'t think the case was properly filed nor did the court have jurisdiction. He also said the public interest groups involved in the case cannot sue in Alabama\'s name. Shaw added that the federal courts should have stayed an order striking down Alabama\'s marriage law until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on it this fall. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . CNN\'s Chandler Friedman and Matt Tettelbach contributed to this report.\n\nSupreme Court could end this chapter of our history once and for all. Even with Alabama entering the marriage equality column, there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights. That\'s why this spring, the Supreme Court will hear a case that will determine whether the U.S. Constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination. Federal judge: Alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses . We\'ve all got to raise our voices in support of couples like Tori and Shant√©. But, after Bush v.\n\n(CNN)What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal judge has struck down Nebraska\'s ban on same-sex marriage, calling it an ""unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens."" U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon\'s decision Monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision. And so, beginning Monday the state must ""treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples"" when it comes to marriage rights, the federal injunction reads. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last? The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court\'s ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others -- most recently Nebraska and Alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here\'s the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages: . The state\'s constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The other is North Dakota. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state\'s 2004 ban. The state\'s ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana\'s appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state\'s constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no ""legitimate purpose."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June.']",The Alabama Supreme Court ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages.,1.0,1.0,0.9877063205105758,simple
What are the risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures?,"The risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures include the transmission of deadly superbugs, such as CRE, due to contaminated scopes that were not properly disinfected. Additionally, manufacturers like Olympus did not obtain permission from the FDA to sell their devices, and there are concerns about the effectiveness of cleaning procedures for these scopes.","['I don\'t know,"" Riley said. ""Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn\'t go through the approval process?"" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who\'s testified to Congress about device safety problems. ""Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing."" In a statement, Olympus said it didn\'t think needed the FDA\'s permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, ""out of an abundance of caution."" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that ""could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device."" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that\'s been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. ""The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn\'t safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA\'s request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn\'t want to take them off the market. ""More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,"" she said. ""We believe the benefits outweigh the risks."" In its statement, Olympus wrote: ""The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community. Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures]."" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus\' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it\'s not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA\'s standard for disinfection. ""We\'re still working with them to get good data,"" she said. Riley said she doesn\'t know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should.\n\n(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn\'t notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA\'s Office of External Affairs. ""Why didn\'t we notice it?\n\nThose were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries. The former president\'s comments were the only moment any Clinton mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy. Neither Hillary or Chelsea Clinton mentioned the issue. At no point Saturday did any of the Clintons address the fact that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as America\'s top diplomat, a practice that skirted legal standards in place. The former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage Saturday and didn\'t mention question about her email, instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation. That didn\'t bother the over 1,000 overachieving millennials at the Clinton Global Initiative University meeting who couldn\'t have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the Clintons the last few weeks. Saturday\'s event is the university-focused branch of the Clinton Foundation. It brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding. This year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things, from increasing women\'s inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog. In total, the foundation will hand out $900,000 to the different students. The general sense among the event attendees was: ""What controversies?"" ""I am here for me. I am here for learning, exploring, meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change,"" said Armel Arnaud Nibasumba, a Middlebury College student born and raised in Burundi. ""I don\'t really care if they address those political issues that are going on."" A few students, including Victoria Arild from Menlo College, said they hadn\'t heard of the controversies. ""I am here because my college, I had the privilege of them funding me,"" she said, before shrugging off questions about the email issues.\n\nSandra Fryhofer. ""It\'s important for both patients and professionals to be on board."" There are still details to work out. ""Who determines what\'s appropriate?"" asked Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu.']","Duodenoscope procedures carry a low risk of bacterial transmission, but recent outbreaks of drug-resistant superbugs have raised concerns. The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, manufactured by Olympus, has been implicated in superbug outbreaks due to a modification in the elevator channel that was intended to make the device safer. However, the modification did not prevent infection. The FDA is asking Olympus and other manufacturers to provide evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned, but so far the data submitted has not met the FDA's disinfection standard. The FDA has not yet decided if Olympus will be penalized for selling the device without permission. The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the healthcare community, and efforts are being made to develop additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with duodenoscope procedures.",1.0,1.0,0.4344099953054964,multi_context
What is Mohammed Emwazi's background and how does ISIS recruit young Muslims?,"Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six. He attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London, where he was described as a quiet, hardworking boy with few friends. Despite his seemingly normal upbringing and good grades, he later became known as the ISIS militant ""Jihadi John"" who appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages.

ISIS recruits young Muslims, like Emwazi, through radical influences, likely outside of school or through social media. They target individuals who may feel torn between different cultures, and use social media to influence and manipulate them. Organizations like CAGE have suggested that individuals like Emwazi may have been driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services, leading them to seek support and validation from extremist groups.","['(his last years) he had settled, he was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice."" He just didn\'t stand out as troubled, she said. ""If there had been any concerns about Mohammed, they would have been picked up, and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done."" Born in Kuwait, but brought up in London from the age of 6, Emwazi was one of the school\'s many students from an immigrant background. The school\'s intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. But its ethos was one of tolerance and integration, with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community. Staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind, Shuter said. They also reached out to the sometimes insular, conservative Muslim communities that many of their students came from, she said, to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures. Nonetheless, Emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences, most likely outside of school or through social media. And he was not alone. At least two other students who attended Quintin Kynaston also allegedly later turned to Islamist extremism. One, Mohammed Sakr, only overlapped at the school by a few months with Shuter. He was reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia in 2012. ""He was very outgoing, jolly, sporty kind of person and fun,"" Shuter said. Shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today. ""I think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control,"" she said. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos. ""My blood just ran cold,"" she said of when she first heard the news. ""When I hear the name, I just find it incredible to marry what I\'ve clearly seen on the TV with the person that I knew. It literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I can\'t believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him. ""I think it\'s horrific, the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for (ISIS). I just think it\'s shocking."" The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who\'s watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. CAGE,  a London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi, has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the UK security services questioning him. They asked about his attitude toward the July 7, 2005, terror attacks in London and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, he says. ""We\'re going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed,"" he alleges they told him. CAGE has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services. It says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups.\n\nLondon (CNN)In his teenage years, there was little to set Mohammed Emwazi -- a quiet, hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates. That\'s according to Joanna Shuter, his former head teacher at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London. Now 26, Emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the ISIS militant nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" who\'s appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages. But in his school days, it was a different matter.\n\nofficials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi\'s statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John\'s voice as her son\'s when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. ""Lie, lie, lie,"" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism.
