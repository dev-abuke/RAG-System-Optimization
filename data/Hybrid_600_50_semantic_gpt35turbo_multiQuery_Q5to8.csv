What is the role of probate judges in the same-sex marriage issue in Alabama?,"The role of probate judges in the same-sex marriage issue in Alabama is to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages, as ordered by the Alabama Supreme Court. They have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the state law that defines marriage as between one man and one woman.","['Supreme Court could end this chapter of our history once and for all. Even with Alabama entering the marriage equality column, there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights. That\'s why this spring, the Supreme Court will hear a case that will determine whether the U.S. Constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination. Federal judge: Alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses . We\'ve all got to raise our voices in support of couples like Tori and Shanté. But, after Bush v.\n\n(CNN)The Alabama Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages. In February, a federal court decision in Mobile County had cleared the path for same-sex marriages to begin in the state. The 134-page order Wednesday was supported by six justices. One dissented and another concurred to most of the opinion and in total to the result. Past and present clash over same-sex marriage in Deep South . Marriage is between one man and one woman under Alabama law, the order states. ""Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty,"" it says. Probate judges have five business days to respond to the order if they don\'t think they are bound to uphold it. ""Same-sex couples in #Alabama should not lose hope because of out-of-step Supreme Court ruling; #marriage fight is far from over.\n\n#ALMarriage,"" tweeted Equality Alabama. The Liberty Counsel, which filed an emergency petition to the state\'s Supreme Court said on its website that ""the ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court offers the most forceful and clearly articulated rebuttal to date of the imaginative arguments for same-sex ""marriage"" employed by federal courts."" In his dissent, Justice Greg Shaw wrote that he didn\'t think the case was properly filed nor did the court have jurisdiction. He also said the public interest groups involved in the case cannot sue in Alabama\'s name. Shaw added that the federal courts should have stayed an order striking down Alabama\'s marriage law until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on it this fall. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . CNN\'s Chandler Friedman and Matt Tettelbach contributed to this report.\n\n(CNN)I like to think I\'m a pretty optimistic person. Even at dark moments for this country -- after 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, for example -- my tendency is always to scout out the sliver of hope for future progress. But I\'ve got to be honest with you, sometimes that optimism only goes so far. The morning after the 2004 election, when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality,  I never thought I\'d see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in Alabama of all places. What\'s more, I certainly never thought that, 50 years after a march for voting rights went from Selma to Montgomery, that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous African-American couple, Tori Sisson and Shanté Wolfe, who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line. They slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state\'s probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling (which supersedes a state ruling) and to refuse to treat LGBT people equally under the law. Even today, more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples. In an interview with CNN\'s Chris Cuomo on Thursday, Chief Justice Moore even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision (which upheld the legal status of slaves as property). I\'m not a trained lawyer, but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law. That logic is not only faulty (restricting rights is not similar to expanding them) but offensive. The 13 states that still ban same-sex marriage . Many are highlighting the echoes of the past in Alabama right now; of Gov. George Wallace actually blocking two African-American students from entering the auditorium of the University of Alabama as they tried to desegregate the school; of civil rights battles come and gone. Me?\n\n(CNN)What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal judge has struck down Nebraska\'s ban on same-sex marriage, calling it an ""unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens."" U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon\'s decision Monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision. And so, beginning Monday the state must ""treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples"" when it comes to marriage rights, the federal injunction reads. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last? The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court\'s ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others -- most recently Nebraska and Alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here\'s the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages: . The state\'s constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The other is North Dakota. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state\'s 2004 ban. The state\'s ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana\'s appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state\'s constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no ""legitimate purpose."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June.']",The Alabama Supreme Court ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages.,1.0,1.0,0.6049101008584079,simple
What are the risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures?,"The risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures include the transmission of deadly superbugs such as CRE, inadequate cleaning of the scopes leading to infections, manufacturers selling devices without FDA clearance, and the difficulty in ensuring thorough cleaning of the scopes to meet FDA standards for disinfection.","['Sandra Fryhofer. ""It\'s important for both patients and professionals to be on board."" There are still details to work out. ""Who determines what\'s appropriate?"" asked Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu.\n\nI don\'t know,"" Riley said. ""Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn\'t go through the approval process?"" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who\'s testified to Congress about device safety problems. ""Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing."" In a statement, Olympus said it didn\'t think needed the FDA\'s permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, ""out of an abundance of caution."" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that ""could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device."" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that\'s been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. ""The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn\'t safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA\'s request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn\'t want to take them off the market. ""More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,"" she said. ""We believe the benefits outweigh the risks."" In its statement, Olympus wrote: ""The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community. Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures]."" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus\' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it\'s not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA\'s standard for disinfection. ""We\'re still working with them to get good data,"" she said. Riley said she doesn\'t know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should.\n\n(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn\'t notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA\'s Office of External Affairs. ""Why didn\'t we notice it?\n\nHe volunteers to speak with medical institutions, as well as with businesses and colleges, to urge them to be more LGBT inclusive. While a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training, if they get any at all. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . For members of the LGBT community who live in more rural and conservative areas like Nebraska, the struggle to get good, or at least up-to-date, medical care may be even more difficult. In general, legal protections and institutional supports for LGBT Nebraskans are already thin, spotty or nonexistent. On March 2, the United States District Court struck down Nebraska\'s ban on marriage for same-sex couples, but that ruling is on appeal. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . Without the legal institution of marriage, LGBT Nebraskans typically lack family health benefits, unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners. A 2014 study from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles found that states without LGBT legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for LGBT residents than states with protections. That plays out in Nebraska. A 2014 study from researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha found that LGBT residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas. Time to close HIV\'s racial disparities . Even when LGBT Nebraskans have health insurance, they struggle to find providers versed in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender heath care needs. Research shows that LGBT individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma. Discrimination has been linked to higher rates of substance abuse, suicide and stress-related illnesses, which can include heart problems, obesity, eating disorders and cancer. If the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues, they may provide inadequate care. Patients who find their doctors do not understand their issues may also delay treatment, often with bad health outcomes, said Jay Irwin, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and a researcher in LGBT health. Sometimes patients are turned away by providers who don\'t want to treat LGBT patients, particularly if there are no laws to prohibit such discrimination. Irwin has completed studies that focus on the health care challenges of lesbians in rural areas and found that many people feel isolated and are afraid to come out -- or risk discrimination in the medical office. Supreme Court same sex marriage decision could impact election .\n\nOf course, that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court\'s power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional. In this case, the ACLU\'s position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far. A hearing is fine, it seems, but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible ""undue burden"" on the right to have an abortion. This has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult, or minor child seeking the abortion. The federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether Alabama\'s law violates established Supreme Court bypass requirements. But what about the actual bypass requirements themselves? They are a creation of the Supreme Court. Striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled Supreme Court precedent is entirely another. What if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox?']","Duodenoscope procedures carry a low risk of bacterial transmission, but recent outbreaks of drug-resistant superbugs have raised concerns.

What is Mohammed Emwazi's background and how does ISIS recruit young Muslims?,"Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six. He attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London and graduated from Westminster University in 2009. He was described as a quiet, hardworking boy with few friends during his school days. Emwazi later became known as ""Jihadi John,"" a high-profile recruit of ISIS who appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages.

ISIS recruits young Muslims through a powerful, slick, modern social media machine that distributes messages daily across various platforms. They produce slick videos featuring attractive jihadists and jihadi brides, promoting the virtues of the utopian Caliphate and a ""guaranteed ticket to paradise."" ISIS propaganda contains a violent, distorted interpretation of Islam, which is more advanced than anything al Qaeda ever produced. The group targets young Muslims, including girls like Aqsa Mahmood, by luring them into a romanticized and glamorous world that bears no relation to the actual misery inflicted by ISIS. The inability of mainstream society to address the anger felt by the Muslim community provides fertile ground for ISIS recruitment.","['(CNN)A decade ago al Qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face; now ISIS engages in one-to-one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away. With what it says is a $2 billion budget, the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry Kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian Caliphate and a ""guaranteed ticket to paradise."" Aqsa Mahmood, 19, left home for university one morning in November 2013 never to return. Instead of going to classes, she travelled to Syria; last February she married a jihadi fighter, and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for ISIS. What is so unusual about Aqsa is that she was given every chance in life: privately educated and offered freedoms that many other Muslim girls would envy. And while most were quick to condemn the Mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization, 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- Aqsa\'s parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites. Following the terror attacks in London on July 7, 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an ""evil ideology,"" a ""perversion of Islam that promoted absurd grievances,"" and that they had nothing to do with the war in Iraq, but he was wrong: the Iraq ""adventure"" opened the gates of hell, and today young Muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative. For over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day Muslims. The need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques. Every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called ""Muslim leaders,"" further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young Muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that ""Islam is a religion of peace."" It is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents, but the steady stream of recruits to ISIS cannot be ignored. Several years ago al Qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in Arabic in front of a black flag, followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards Americans. It wasn\'t particularly effective as a recruitment tool, but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever. Today ISIS runs a powerful, slick, modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms. Their propaganda contains the same violent, distorted interpretation of Islam but it is more advanced than anything al Qaeda ever produced, and the authorities cannot police it or compete with it. For many, the greatest shock has been young girls like Aqsa wanting to leave behind their Western comforts and freedoms to join ISIS, but why should it be a surprise that young Muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts? There is no single road map to recruitment, but for a teenager becoming a Jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber, however distorted that logic may seem to us. Full of adolescent frustration, young Muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by ISIS. It doesn\'t matter if the narrative is false, because ISIS is winning the propaganda war: the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the Muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers. ISIS is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy, Israel, rendition, torture, or Assad\'s reign, which has left 200,000 dead, because there is nothing that Western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards. Aqsa\'s family describe her as a ""bedroom radical"" of the type the British Government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media. Yet last year the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence found ""little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization."" A concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists. Many young Muslim people asserting their identity in an Islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders, whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day Islam.\n\nofficials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi\'s statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John\'s voice as her son\'s when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. ""Lie, lie, lie,"" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London. CNN\'s Samira Said, Roba Alhenawi and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.\n\nThere isn\'t much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability."" Details from court papers reported in British media paint a different picture. They say Emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the ""North London Boys"" who allegedly funneled money and recruits to Al-Shabaab. The Guardian has reported that Emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed London bomb attacks in 2005. To British authorities, his face was a familiar one for more than five years. But authorities lost track of him in 2013, according to friends. He changed his name and made his way to Syria. Analysts who\'ve studied ISIS recruiting say they aren\'t buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned Emwazi into ""Jihadi John."" ""I think it\'s an absurd claim,"" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. ""It was not the cause of his radicalization. The reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the Shabaab in Somalia."" Ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism. ""People do not turn around, when harassed and have grievances, and become terrorists,"" he said. In addition to the emails released by CAGE, another series of emails from Emwazi came to light over the weekend. The messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the Daily Mail\'s security editor, Robert Verkaik. The Daily Mail published excerpts from those exchanges, including Emwazi\'s description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website, but only stated his surname. When he met a potential buyer at a London underground station, he says the person he met shook his hand and said ""nice doing business with you Mohammed."" ""I NEVER TOLD THIS PERSON MY FIRST NAME!!"" wrote Emwazi to Verkaik. ""& I NEVER GIVE OUT MY FIRST NAME!!\n\nThere (were) no issues with him. There were no problems."" Emwazi became even more focused in his last few years at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, she said. ""He was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice,"" Shuter told CNN this week, referring to London\'s Westminster University, from which Emwazi graduated in 2009. Contrast that perception with that of the masked, deep-voiced, British-accented man who months ago was dubbed Jihadi John. There is nothing shy, nothing gentle, nothing playful about him. He starred in grisly ISIS videos depicting the beheading of hostages, punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the United States. A man who says he is Emwazi\'s father told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas that ""there is nothing that proves"" the man known as Jihadi John is his son, Mohammed. His Kuwait-based lawyer, Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN that the family plans to sue anyone who makes the connection, calling the father Jassem Emwazi a ""victim of libel."" Yet Western authorities have made just such a link. They say that the Kuwaiti-born Mohammed Emwazi went from being a typical ""boy next door"" type growing up in West London to being one of the most high-profile recruits of ISIS, the Islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in Syria and Iraq. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN indicate that, as far back as 2009, British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. And in late February, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed reports in British and other media that Emwazi went on to join ISIS and is the man known as Jihadi John.\n\nLondon (CNN)In his teenage years, there was little to set Mohammed Emwazi -- a quiet, hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates. That\'s according to Joanna Shuter, his former head teacher at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London. Now 26, Emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the ISIS militant nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" who\'s appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages. But in his school days, it was a different matter.\n\n(CNN)It\'s a controversial question that\'s sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as Jihadi John. Was Mohammed Emwazi, the man with a British accent who\'s appeared in numerous ISIS beheading videos, pushed toward extremism by authorities? Or was he someone who\'d long been heading down a militant path? A London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. And a report from the Daily Mail, also citing emails purportedly sent from Emwazi to the British publication, said the Kuwait-born Londoner saw himself as a ""dead man walking"" and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups. ""You can\'t start the story at how he\'s been treated by UK officials. You certainly can\'t start the story from the email trail,"" said Rashad Ali, director at the counterextremism consultancy CENTRI and a fellow of the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. ""You have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him. Well, because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join Al-Shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in Somalia."" Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE, the human rights and Muslim advocacy organization that worked with him. One email details Emwazi\'s account of his detention at a British airport, when authorities stopped him from traveling to Kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours. ""I told them that I want to be left alone, as I have an ambition of moving from the UK and settling in Kuwait. That is why I found a job and a spouse!! But they laughed,"" Emwazi wrote in a message dated June 3, 2010. ""One of them got aggressive with me, he pushed me to the wall.\n\n(his last years) he had settled, he was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice."" He just didn\'t stand out as troubled, she said. ""If there had been any concerns about Mohammed, they would have been picked up, and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done."" Born in Kuwait, but brought up in London from the age of 6, Emwazi was one of the school\'s many students from an immigrant background. The school\'s intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. But its ethos was one of tolerance and integration, with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community. Staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind, Shuter said. They also reached out to the sometimes insular, conservative Muslim communities that many of their students came from, she said, to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures. Nonetheless, Emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences, most likely outside of school or through social media. And he was not alone. At least two other students who attended Quintin Kynaston also allegedly later turned to Islamist extremism. One, Mohammed Sakr, only overlapped at the school by a few months with Shuter. He was reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia in 2012. ""He was very outgoing, jolly, sporty kind of person and fun,"" Shuter said. Shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today. ""I think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control,"" she said. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos. ""My blood just ran cold,"" she said of when she first heard the news. ""When I hear the name, I just find it incredible to marry what I\'ve clearly seen on the TV with the person that I knew. It literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I can\'t believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him. ""I think it\'s horrific, the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for (ISIS). I just think it\'s shocking."" The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who\'s watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. CAGE,  a London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi, has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the UK security services questioning him. They asked about his attitude toward the July 7, 2005, terror attacks in London and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, he says. ""We\'re going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed,"" he alleges they told him. CAGE has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services. It says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups.']","A man who says he's Mohammed Emwazi's father has reportedly said there is no proof that his son is the masked ISIS killer known as ""Jihadi John.""

Jassem Emwazi said there are only ""false rumors"" circulating about his son. The elder Emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney. The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John.
