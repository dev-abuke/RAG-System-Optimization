"What is the term for the time it takes Iran to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, and how does the number of centrifuges affect this ""break-out time""?","The term for the time it takes Iran to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon is ""break-out time."" The number of centrifuges affects this break-out time because the more centrifuges Iran has, the faster they can enrich uranium and potentially produce enough material for a nuclear weapon in a shorter amount of time.","['can do what they want."" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium. That figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted. Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is not that important, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the ""breakout time""  -- to at least a year.

Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium, a process that can lead to weapons-grade material.

Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile.

On Monday, a senior State Department official said negotiators had not yet\n\nimposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time. This platform is diametrically opposed to the P5+1 position: that Iran should maintain a relatively small nuclear infrastructure and that the moratorium on Iran\'s nuclear activities should last at least a decade. And of critical importance, particularly to the United States, is the insistence that Iran be held to a minimum one-year ""breakout time"" -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement. So even as negotiators express some optimism about the progression of talks, it\'s clear that there are major gaps to bridge, which may be why some U.S. officials have put the odds of reaching a deal at 50% or less. 3.

While the focus this week is on the March 31\n\nU.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. New machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15-year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, which would be relaxed over the last five.

"What does ""Gift Horse"" by Hans Haacke say about art and commerce, considering its historical references and location in Trafalgar Square?","""Gift Horse"" by Hans Haacke explores the relationship between art and commerce by portraying a skeletal riderless horse with an electronic ticker showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. The sculpture is a wry comment on the equestrian statue of King William IV that was originally planned for the plinth more than 150 years ago. By incorporating historical references and being located in Trafalgar Square, a popular tourist spot in London, the artwork prompts debate and reflection on the interconnectedness of art, power, money, and history.","['Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text.

What was Simone Gbagbo's role in the crimes against humanity in Ivory Coast and its relation to the 2010 post-election violence?,"Simone Gbagbo was convicted for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following the post-election violence in Ivory Coast in 2010, which left more than 3,000 people dead.
