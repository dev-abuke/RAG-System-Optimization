What are the risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures?,"The risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures include the potential for bacterial transmission, specifically the deadly superbug CRE, due to inadequate cleaning of the scopes. There is also a concern about the modifications made to the duodenoscope by Olympus to prevent infection, as it was still linked to superbug outbreaks. Additionally, there is a pending FDA application for permission to sell the scope, and concerns about the effectiveness of cleaning procedures for duodenoscopes from multiple manufacturers.","['I don\'t know,"" Riley said. ""Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn\'t go through the approval process?"" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who\'s testified to Congress about device safety problems. ""Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing."" In a statement, Olympus said it didn\'t think needed the FDA\'s permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, ""out of an abundance of caution."" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that ""could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device."" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that\'s been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. ""The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn\'t safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA\'s request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn\'t want to take them off the market. ""More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,"" she said. ""We believe the benefits outweigh the risks."" In its statement, Olympus wrote: ""The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.

Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it\'s not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA\'s standard for disinfection.

What is Mohammed Emwazi's background and how does ISIS recruit young Muslims?,"Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait but brought up in London from the age of 6. He was described as a typical ""boy next door"" type growing up in West London. He attended a school with a multicultural background and ethos of tolerance and integration. Despite efforts by the school staff to prevent radicalization, Emwazi and at least two other students were drawn in by radical influences, likely through social media or outside influences. ISIS recruits young Muslims by aggressively using social media to lure them into joining their ranks, pushing a false narrative of what life is really like in their territory.","['(his last years) he had settled, he was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice."" He just didn\'t stand out as troubled, she said. ""If there had been any concerns about Mohammed, they would have been picked up, and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done."" Born in Kuwait, but brought up in London from the age of 6, Emwazi was one of the school\'s many students from an immigrant background. The school\'s intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. But its ethos was one of tolerance and integration, with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community. Staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind, Shuter said. They also reached out to the sometimes insular, conservative Muslim communities that many of their students came from, she said, to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures. Nonetheless, Emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences, most likely outside of school or through social media. And he was not alone. At least two other students who attended Quintin Kynaston also allegedly later turned to Islamist extremism. One, Mohammed Sakr, only overlapped at the school by a few months with Shuter. He was reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia in 2012. ""He was very outgoing, jolly, sporty kind of person and fun,"" Shuter said. Shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today. ""I think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control,"" she said. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos. ""My blood just ran cold,"" she said of when she first heard the news. ""When I hear the name, I just find it incredible to marry what I\'ve clearly seen on the TV with the person that I knew. It literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I can\'t believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him. ""I think it\'s horrific, the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for (ISIS). I just think it\'s shocking."" The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who\'s watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. CAGE,  a London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi, has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the UK security services questioning him. They asked about his attitude toward the July 7, 2005, terror attacks in London and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, he says. ""We\'re going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed,"" he alleges they told him. CAGE has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services. It says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups.\n\na link. They say that the Kuwaiti-born Mohammed Emwazi went from being a typical ""boy next door"" type growing up in West London to being one of the most high-profile recruits of ISIS, the Islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in Syria and Iraq. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN indicate that, as far back as 2009, British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa.

Jassem Emwazi said there are only ""false rumors"" circulating about his son. The elder Emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney. The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John. The lawyer called the father a ""victim of libel"" and said that he would soon hold a news conference. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi's statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John's voice as her son's when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. ""Lie, lie, lie,"" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London.",0.6,1.0,0.5359870989772653,multi_context
What significant achievement did the Iraqi forces make in their offensive to retake Tikrit from ISIS?,"The Iraqi forces captured key areas in their offensive to take back Tikrit, including the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city.","['The predominantly Shiite militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salaheddin province. ISIS wasn\'t making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from front-line positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi\'s media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government.\n\nIrbil, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, even uniting Sunni and Shiite fighters in the mission. The Iraqi army, along with Sunni and Shiite militiamen, attacked ISIS strongholds in the area Monday, the state-run Iraqiya TV reported. Iraqi warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around Tikrit. It\'s part of a wide-scale offensive ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group\'s capture of Iraq\'s second-largest city, Mosul. Tikrit is best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria. Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour. The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared. What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout. Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. While Iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area, it has generally been under ISIS control for the last eight months or so. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the Shia al-Hashed al-Shaabi militia, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades, and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he will ""oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit"" from ISIS. In short, this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to ISIS last summer after a string of dramatic defeats. Last June, Tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by ISIS militants. They captured more than a thousand Iraqi soldiers, who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by U.S. forces. ISIS subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers, and posted the video of the killing online. There is concern that Iraqi forces, eager for revenge, may kill combatants and civilians alike. The U.N.\'s envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, urged all armed forces in Tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians. U.S.\n\nBaghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces now have control of Tikrit Military Hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from ISIS. The joint forces raised the Iraqi flag from the hospital premises Wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides, the Hashd Al-Shaabi paramilitary force said. The predominantly Shia militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit from ISIS. The hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace.

Lu\'s mother abandoned him after he was born and his father works as a carpenter in Shandong province hundreds of miles further north. He comes back perhaps once a year.

What measures can be taken to improve security in aviation and prevent incidents like the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash?,"Measures that can be taken to improve security in aviation and prevent incidents like the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash include implementing more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, instituting additional security measures, regularly evaluating pilots, and potentially having a ""flight recorder"" for the human brain.","['Robert Bales, a 38-year-old father of two, opened fire and killed 16 innocent Afghan civilians. When examining Germanwings Flight 9525 from the ""cockpit of the human mind,"" one must ask this question: How can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being? As a psychologist, I would, of course, advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this. Just as aircraft are inspected and maintained, it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane. But, just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error, with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft, there will always be an element of unpredictability present. And, unless we had a ""flight recorder"" for the human brain, we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. One thing is for sure: the tragic events of Flight 9525 will surely renew conversation about what happened to Flight MH370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance.\n\nThe pilot\'s actions. It will be months, or longer, before the causes behind Tuesday\'s crash of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 are known, but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators. Speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this, but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened. The most useful clues so far: . One of the plane\'s ""black boxes"" has been recovered, the French interior minister said. The data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash. Its contents are still unknown, but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash. France\'s aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately, the interior minister said. Real-time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story. According to online flight trackers, the Germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when, about 30 minutes into the trip, it started descending. Six minutes later, it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet. It continued to descend after that -- it\'s last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet. The rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. If the engines had stalled, the plane would have crashed in less time, she said. Departure: Barcelona, Spain, at 10:01 a.m. (26 minutes late) Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m. Passengers: 150 (144 passengers, six crew members) Airplane: Airbus A320 (twin-jet) Airline: Germanwings (budget airline owned by Lufthansa) Flight distance: 726 miles .
