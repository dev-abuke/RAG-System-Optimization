"What group is responsible for the attack in Baidoa, Somalia?","['Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Islamic militants with the extremist group Al-Shabaab mounted a bloody attack Thursday on government administration offices in Baidoa, Somalia. Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group\'s official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president\'s house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union\'s special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, condemned the attack, saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to Baidoa. ""I am deeply saddened by news of the attack in Baidoa this morning,"" he said in a statement released by AMISOM, the African Union mission to Somalia. Sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a Mogadishu hotel Wednesday night. ""These are desperate attempts by Al-Shabaab to seek relevance, following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the Somali National Army working together with AMISOM troops,"" he said. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, even calling, in a video released last month, for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. U.S. authorities downplayed the threat. How big a threat is Al-Shabaab to the United States?

What factors have contributed to the sharp decline in readers of newspapers in Nigeria?,"['Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)It\'s a unique world where friendships are forged, deals struck and more than the occasional argument breaks out. Welcome to Nigeria\'s free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. They are called ""free"" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president. Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. ""They are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me,"" he said. Mgbachi told CNN that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments, mostly the Premier League, and also during the election campaign period. To avoid losing out on sales too much, Mgbachi has developed an interesting business model: ""I decided not to make (reading) completely free. For some of the dailies, its 20 naira,(10 cents) 30 naira (15 cents) for the sports papers and 50 naira (30 cents) for the magazines. ""It\'s not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person,"" he added. Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers. The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited. They talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper. One told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Most of Nigeria\'s $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.']","The factors that have contributed to the sharp decline in readers of newspapers in Nigeria include the rise of internet news consumption and the dire economic situation in the country, where many people cannot afford to buy newspapers.",simple,[{'id': '17826cf095dd6517a4c8b7baf46ed2cbc5522d23'}],True
What factors contribute to considering the deliberate destruction of Germanwings Flight 9525 as an act of terrorism and how can psychological screening and testing for pilots help prevent such incidents in the future?,"['(CNN)As relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard Germanwings Flight 9525, the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. I happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy: a recent graduate of Drexel University -- where I teach -- and her mother were on the ill-fated flight, I lived in Germany for 18 years and I am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness. While the engineering of the Airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing, what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine. When complex engineering systems interact with human factors, it is most often the human that causes the anomaly. Humans are far less reliable than machines. The average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities, and is psychologically stable and reliable. While it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents, the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane. However, very often, as apparently is the case here, something went wrong with the human flying the plane. Pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected. The U.S. Navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers. But we have learned that the German company Lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate Germanwings do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process. Psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in Germany as it is in the United States. Perhaps it should be. A fitness-for-duty evaluation asks this important question: Can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint? The deliberate destruction of Flight 9525 by a single person, most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave, can also be considered an act of terrorism. The action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective. Research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd, unexplainable violent actions. Their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework, or it may be associated with something deeply personal. Examples include Richard Reid, the failed shoe bomber; Eric Rudolph, the Olympic bomber; or Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. In 2009, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army officer and psychiatrist, went on a shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and wounding 32. And in 2012, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, a 38-year-old father of two, opened fire and killed 16 innocent Afghan civilians. When examining Germanwings Flight 9525 from the ""cockpit of the human mind,"" one must ask this question: How can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being? As a psychologist, I would, of course, advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this. Just as aircraft are inspected and maintained, it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane. But, just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error, with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft, there will always be an element of unpredictability present. And, unless we had a ""flight recorder"" for the human brain, we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. One thing is for sure: the tragic events of Flight 9525 will surely renew conversation about what happened to Flight MH370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance.']","The deliberate destruction of Germanwings Flight 9525 can be considered an act of terrorism because it involved the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective.

Who was the founding prime minister of Singapore and what role did he play in its economic rise?,"['(CNN)Thousands of Singaporeans gathered in pouring rain Sunday to bid farewell to Lee Kuan Yew, the Southeast Asian city-state\'s founding prime minister who charted its spectacular economic rise. Draped in the national flag, Lee\'s coffin was taken on a solemn procession through the sodden streets of the tropical city, where crowds of mourners defied the downpour to pay their last respects. The funeral service was attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished. We have lost our founding father Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, who lived and breathed Singapore all his life,"" Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is one of Lee\'s sons, said in a eulogy. Lee died early Monday morning at age 91, prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the world. He had been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded Singapore, a former British colony, in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia. He served as its prime minister for more than three decades, shaping the once poor trading post into a wealthy financial center. He continued to play an important role in government until his final years. After Lee\'s death, hundreds of thousands of people joined huge lines to pay respects to the former leader as his body lay in state at Singapore\'s Parliament House for several days last week. The procession Sunday weaved past a number of notable Singapore landmarks on the way to the University Cultural Centre, where the state funeral service took place. ""Together, we came not only to mourn. Together, we celebrate Mr. Lee Kuan Yew\'s long and full life, and what he has achieved with us, his people,"" his son said in his eulogy. Lee was also honored by a 21-gun salute and a minute of silence, as well as displays by the Singapore Air Force and the Singapore Navy. The funeral service was to be followed by a private cremation. Other international figures attending the funeral included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Leader of the U.K. House of Commons William Hague and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Although Lee is admired for the economic success he helped Singapore achieve, he also drew criticism for curbing media freedoms and the treatment of political opponents. ""While remembering his deeds that helped build Singapore up to what it is today, the government should also mark the passing of Lee Kuan Yew, by making a break from the politics of yesteryear that were too often marked by restrictions on basic civil and political rights,"" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\'s Asia division, said in a statement Sunday.']",Lee Kuan Yew was the founding prime minister of Singapore and he played a pivotal role in its economic rise.

"What is the term used to describe the overuse of psychiatric medication, particularly among women, and its effects on mood and emotional well-being?","['(CNN)Modern women are suffering from an energy crisis. Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world\'s population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a ""new normal,"" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don\'t are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it\'s like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn\'t normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women\'s emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from ""Should I take an antidepressant?"" to ""Which one should I take?"" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people\'s behavior affects others. We cry when we\'re touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we\'re angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we\'ve been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we\'re stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don\'t go too far away from nature and what\'s natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don\'t we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a ""plastic vortex"" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough.

What is the role of probate judges in the same-sex marriage issue in Alabama?,"['(CNN)The Alabama Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered probate judges in the state to stop issuing licenses for same-sex marriages.

What are the risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures?,"['(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn\'t notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA\'s Office of External Affairs. ""Why didn\'t we notice it? I don\'t know,"" Riley said. ""Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn\'t go through the approval process?"" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who\'s testified to Congress about device safety problems. ""Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing."" In a statement, Olympus said it didn\'t think needed the FDA\'s permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, ""out of an abundance of caution."" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that ""could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device."" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that\'s been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. ""The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn\'t safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA\'s request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn\'t want to take them off the market. ""More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,"" she said. ""We believe the benefits outweigh the risks."" In its statement, Olympus wrote: ""The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures]."" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus\' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it\'s not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA\'s standard for disinfection. ""We\'re still working with them to get good data,"" she said. Riley said she doesn\'t know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. ""It\'s like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?"" she said.']","Duodenoscope procedures carry a low risk of bacterial transmission, but recent outbreaks of drug-resistant superbugs have raised concerns.

However, the modification did not prevent infection. The FDA is asking Olympus and other manufacturers to provide evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned, but so far the data submitted has not met the FDA's disinfection standard.

What is Mohammed Emwazi's background and how does ISIS recruit young Muslims?,"['(CNN)A man who says he\'s Mohammed Emwazi\'s father has reportedly said there is no proof that his son is the masked ISIS killer known as ""Jihadi John."" ""There is nothing that proves what is being circulated in the media, especially through video clips and footage, that the accused is my son Mohammed, who is being referred to as the alleged executioner"" of ISIS, Jassem Emwazi told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas. Jassem Emwazi said there are only ""false rumors"" circulating about his son. The elder Emwazi told the newspaper he has hired an attorney. The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John. The lawyer called the father a ""victim of libel"" and said that he would soon hold a news conference. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that ""Jihadi John"" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. Jassem Emwazi\'s statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John\'s voice as her son\'s when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages. Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. ""Lie, lie, lie,"" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London. CNN\'s Samira Said, Roba Alhenawi and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.', '(CNN)A decade ago al Qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face; now ISIS engages in one-to-one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away. With what it says is a $2 billion budget, the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry Kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian Caliphate and a ""guaranteed ticket to paradise."" Aqsa Mahmood, 19, left home for university one morning in November 2013 never to return. Instead of going to classes, she travelled to Syria; last February she married a jihadi fighter, and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for ISIS. What is so unusual about Aqsa is that she was given every chance in life: privately educated and offered freedoms that many other Muslim girls would envy. And while most were quick to condemn the Mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization, 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- Aqsa\'s parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites. Following the terror attacks in London on July 7, 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an ""evil ideology,"" a ""perversion of Islam that promoted absurd grievances,"" and that they had nothing to do with the war in Iraq, but he was wrong: the Iraq ""adventure"" opened the gates of hell, and today young Muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative. For over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day Muslims. The need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques. Every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called ""Muslim leaders,"" further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young Muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that ""Islam is a religion of peace."" It is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents, but the steady stream of recruits to ISIS cannot be ignored. Several years ago al Qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in Arabic in front of a black flag, followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards Americans. It wasn\'t particularly effective as a recruitment tool, but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever. Today ISIS runs a powerful, slick, modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms. Their propaganda contains the same violent, distorted interpretation of Islam but it is more advanced than anything al Qaeda ever produced, and the authorities cannot police it or compete with it. For many, the greatest shock has been young girls like Aqsa wanting to leave behind their Western comforts and freedoms to join ISIS, but why should it be a surprise that young Muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts? There is no single road map to recruitment, but for a teenager becoming a Jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber, however distorted that logic may seem to us. Full of adolescent frustration, young Muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by ISIS. It doesn\'t matter if the narrative is false, because ISIS is winning the propaganda war: the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the Muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers. ISIS is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy, Israel, rendition, torture, or Assad\'s reign, which has left 200,000 dead, because there is nothing that Western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards. Aqsa\'s family describe her as a ""bedroom radical"" of the type the British Government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media. Yet last year the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence found ""little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization."" A concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists. Many young Muslim people asserting their identity in an Islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders, whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day Islam. While mosques pay lip service to the ""brotherhood of man"" they exclude 50% of the community by discouraging women from attending, and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect. As for racial unity, it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist. Young British Muslims live a schizophrenic existence, stuck between their immigrant parents\' cultural identity and that of the West which doesn\'t want them. Extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life.

What significant achievement did the Iraqi forces make in their offensive to retake Tikrit from ISIS?,"(CNN)Iraqi forces say they've captured key areas in their offensive to take back Tikrit, which has been under ISIS control since June. The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet, Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",The Iraqi forces captured key areas in their offensive to retake Tikrit from ISIS.

How does the hukou system impact left-behind children in China in terms of education and social services?,"Chao Hu, Anhui, China (CNN)Six-year-old Lu Yiming is a handful. One minute, he's on the concrete roof of his two-story house, the next he's fiddling with fireworks. Now, he's skating down an alley. ""Come back here!"" yells his grandmother. ""I have such a headache raising this child,"" 72-year-old old Tang Xinying confides. Lu's mother abandoned him after he was born and his father works as a carpenter in Shandong province hundreds of miles further north. He comes back perhaps once a year. In China, Lu is what's called a ""left-behind child."" Conservatively, there are at least 61 million such children in China -- that's a staggering one in five. They struggle at school, have higher rates of mental health issues, and suffer from more behavioral problems than their contemporaries. ""I tell him 'your father is working and your mother doesn't want you,'"" says an exasperated Tang. In Chao Hu, a village in the inland province of Anhui, a dead-end track passes by half-finished housing projects and abandoned fields. A yellow haze hangs in the air leaving a metallic taste in the mouth. China's industrial pollution made it out here, but the jobs haven't. Everyone of working age in Chao Hu has gone to the cities to find work, leaving the old and very young behind. Lu holds my hand as we walk through the tiny village. A group of old women sit on three-legged wooden stools listening to Chinese opera on a small radio. Another walks by knitting. Some old men make bootleg liquor in an oil drum. ""We don't have fields that we can farm, if you don't go out to work, then how do you earn an income?"" says Tang. ""Their parents have to work outside of town and they cannot bring their children with them."" The All China Women's Federation, a state- backed organization, paints a bleak picture for left behind children. A steady stream of state media reports highlights the abuse suffered by left behind children. And crimes are often blamed on them. ""It has a huge impact on society and the generation of people who grow up without parents,"" says Ines Kaempfer, of the Center for Child-Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility. ""There is a generation of Chinese society that lacks security and trust. It could have a potentially disastrous effect."" Unintended consequences of mass urbanization and migration are not unique to China. But draconian rules have made the problem worse. China's much-hated hukou system registers families as either rural or urban. Most migrants can't change their household registration when they move. They struggle to access healthcare and other social services in urban areas. Their children can't go to public schools -- even if they are born in the cities. Critics say the hukou system has created a vast underclass of cheap labor to help drive China's manufacturing revolution. Recognizing some of its failures, the Chinese Communist Party has proposed reforms of the hukou system including doing away with temporary residence permits. The topic is under discussion this week at the annual meeting of China's National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp parliament. ""Though it is better than before, the hukou system is a huge problem,"" says Professor Fan Bin, of the Huadong Technology Institute. ""Migrants can't afford to keep their children in big cities, the rent is high and the wages are low, and they can't pay the tuition for private schools."" In Chao Hu village, Tang is cooking a meal of rice and spinach for her grandson. She swirls peanut oil on her simple stove top. ""I can't teach my grandson well. This boy should be educated by his father and mother,"" she says, ""I cannot catch him when he runs away from me. I cannot discipline him when he misbehaves."" Tang is convinced she can't give her grandson the support he needs. ""We don't have a choice, even if the situation isn't good. If I don't take care of him who will,"" she says. CNN's Serena Dong contributed to this report.","The hukou system in China has a significant impact on left-behind children in terms of education and social services.

What measures can be taken to improve security in aviation and prevent incidents like the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash?,"['(CNN)As relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard Germanwings Flight 9525, the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. I happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy: a recent graduate of Drexel University -- where I teach -- and her mother were on the ill-fated flight, I lived in Germany for 18 years and I am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness. While the engineering of the Airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing, what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine. When complex engineering systems interact with human factors, it is most often the human that causes the anomaly. Humans are far less reliable than machines. The average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities, and is psychologically stable and reliable. While it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents, the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane. However, very often, as apparently is the case here, something went wrong with the human flying the plane. Pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected. The U.S. Navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers. But we have learned that the German company Lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate Germanwings do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process. Psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in Germany as it is in the United States. Perhaps it should be. A fitness-for-duty evaluation asks this important question: Can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint? The deliberate destruction of Flight 9525 by a single person, most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave, can also be considered an act of terrorism. The action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective. Research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd, unexplainable violent actions. Their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework, or it may be associated with something deeply personal. Examples include Richard Reid, the failed shoe bomber; Eric Rudolph, the Olympic bomber; or Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. In 2009, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army officer and psychiatrist, went on a shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and wounding 32. And in 2012, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, a 38-year-old father of two, opened fire and killed 16 innocent Afghan civilians. When examining Germanwings Flight 9525 from the ""cockpit of the human mind,"" one must ask this question: How can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being? As a psychologist, I would, of course, advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this. Just as aircraft are inspected and maintained, it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane. But, just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error, with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft, there will always be an element of unpredictability present. And, unless we had a ""flight recorder"" for the human brain, we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. One thing is for sure: the tragic events of Flight 9525 will surely renew conversation about what happened to Flight MH370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance.']","As a psychologist, I would advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this.

What is Netanyahu's stance on the two-state solution and its relation to the Iran deal?,"['Jerusalem (CNN)Within 48 hours of his election night victory, Benjamin Netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no Palestinian state if he were Prime Minister, but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations: the United States and the Palestinians. In an interview with NBC, Netanyahu said, ""I haven\'t changed my policy, I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality, Abu Mazen (nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state, and he\'s made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel. And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace. I don\'t want a one-state solution, I want a sustainable two-state solution."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that Netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution. He says the Palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations. ""I\'ve negotiated with them for 20 years, and I complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator,"" Erekat said. ""All Netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust, not only of me but of the international community, he needs to stand tall and tell the Israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we\'re going to have to recognize the state of Palestine."" Erekat says the Palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the United Nations, a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full UN member state in December. A new United Nations Security Council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second Palestinian bid. So where does that leave the United States? The White House said it would ""reassess"" the relationship between the United States and Israel. The broad relationship includes security cooperation, financial assistance, and strong diplomatic ties. Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections. But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel. Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations. The last peace talks, moderated by Secretary of State John Kerry, broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations. As the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline, Israel withdrew from the negotiations when Fatah announced a reconciliation with Hamas, a militant Islamic group, and an intention to form a unity government. In a phone call with Netanyahu, President Barack Obama congratulated Netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution. But with so much skepticism on both sides, a lasting peace remains a distant goal.']","Netanyahu's stance on the two-state solution is that he supports a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. However, he believes that the reality has changed, with the Palestinian leader refusing to recognize the Jewish state and making a pact with Hamas. He also expresses concerns about Islamist forces taking over vacated territories in the Middle East. As for the relation to the Iran deal, the context does not provide any information about Netanyahu's stance on this specific issue.",multi_context,[{'id': 'b8ccb86c2daa148130493cefb1368500ab73fc14'}],True
