What are the risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures?,"The risks and controversies associated with duodenoscope procedures include the potential for bacterial transmission, specifically the risk of infection with drug-resistant microorganisms.

Manufacturers may need to seek clearance for new models if changes are made to the design.","['that it wasn\'t safer,"" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA\'s request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn\'t want to take them off the market.

The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, manufactured by Olympus, has been implicated in superbug outbreaks due to a modification in the elevator channel that was intended to make the device safer. However, the modification did not prevent infection. The FDA is asking Olympus and other manufacturers to provide evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned, but so far the data submitted has not met the FDA's disinfection standard. The FDA has not yet decided if Olympus will be penalized for selling the device without permission.

What is Mohammed Emwazi's background and how does ISIS recruit young Muslims?,"Mohammed Emwazi was a Kuwaiti-born individual who grew up in West London as a typical ""boy next door"" type.

How does the hukou system impact left-behind children in China in terms of education and social services?,"The hukou system in China impacts left-behind children by preventing them from accessing public schools and other social services in urban areas, even if they are born in the cities.
