What is the purpose and impact of Nigeria's free readers associations?,"['Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)It\'s a unique world where friendships are forged, deals struck and more than the occasional argument breaks out. Welcome to Nigeria\'s free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. They are called ""free"" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president. Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. ""They are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me,"" he said. Mgbachi told CNN that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments, mostly the Premier League, and also during the election campaign period. To avoid losing out on sales too much, Mgbachi has developed an interesting business model: ""I decided not to make (reading) completely free. For some of the dailies, its 20 naira,(10 cents) 30 naira (15 cents) for the sports papers and 50 naira (30 cents) for the magazines. ""It\'s not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person,"" he added. Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers. The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited. They talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper. One told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Most of Nigeria\'s $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.']","The purpose of Nigeria's free readers associations is to gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day.

What role did Ronda Rousey play in Wrestlemania 31?,"['(CNN)Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson had a way better weekend than you. The actor hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and rocked out in some memorable sketches, including a live-action ""Bambi"" remake with some of the ""SNL"" cast portraying actors from the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. ""Whan I was a boy, they took away my mother,"" Johnson said in character as a muscle-bound, gun-wielding Bambi. ""And now it\'s time for them to pay ... dearly.""

"What was the target and casualty count of the attack in Baidoa, Somalia?","['Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Islamic militants with the extremist group Al-Shabaab mounted a bloody attack Thursday on government administration offices in Baidoa, Somalia. Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group\'s official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president\'s house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union\'s special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, condemned the attack, saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to Baidoa. ""I am deeply saddened by news of the attack in Baidoa this morning,"" he said in a statement released by AMISOM, the African Union mission to Somalia. Sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a Mogadishu hotel Wednesday night. ""These are desperate attempts by Al-Shabaab to seek relevance, following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the Somali National Army working together with AMISOM troops,"" he said. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, even calling, in a video released last month, for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. U.S. authorities downplayed the threat. How big a threat is Al-Shabaab to the United States?

What led to Arnold Palmer's shoulder dislocation during the Father-Son Challenge in Florida?,"['(CNN)He may be suffering from the effects of a dislocated shoulder -- but golf legend Arnold Palmer has vowed that won\'t stop him from hitting his ceremonial opening tee shot at the Masters in Augusta next month. The 85-year-old, speaking to reporters at the Trump Doral resort where he was opening a villa named after him, said he would look forward ""to being out on that tee even if I fan it."" Palmer\'s injury happened when he had a fall at the Father-Son Challenge in Florida shortly before Christmas. He explained: ""I was going to make a speech at the Father-Son and I tripped on a carpet and did a 360."" But the four-time Masters champion, who hit his first ceremonial opening shot back in 2007, said nothing would prevent him from joining fellow greats Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player on the course on April 9 -- even though doctors won\'t allow him to swing a golf club just yet. ""Oh yeah, I plan on it,"" Palmer, known as \'the King,\' said. ""I haven\'t been practicing... I\'m not allowed to swing yet. [But] I will whatever.""

What are the latest census findings on the tiger population in India and what factors have influenced this change?,"['(CNN)""The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man."" I still remember the first time I read the passage from ""The Jungle Book,"" heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with The Six Million Dollar Man. ""The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs, rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers,"" Rudyard Kipling wrote. I probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in Milwaukee, but to my 11-year-old brain, Kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind Piggly Wiggly. ""The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him."" Reading that passage 35 years later, while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic, the irony in that line finally clicks. When we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine, my grown-up heart pounds once again. It is a sign that there may be big cats nearby. ""I wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild? And are they alive today?"" These are the questions that launched this stop on ""The Wonder List,"" and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century: Is the planet still big enough for man and man-eater? India is about one-third the size of the continental United States, with four times as many people. That kind of human pressure has changed Kipling\'s ""Law of the Jungle"" in dramatic ways. According to the animal conservation group Born Free, there are more tigers in cages in Texas than in the forests of India. So I set out to understand how and why. Having covered the poaching of African animals to feed the huge market for Asian medicine, I assumed the demand for tiger-skin rugs in Dubai or tiger-bone wine in Beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat. Can tigers claw their way back from the brink? But it turns out that tiger-human conflict is a much bigger problem. Almost half a billion rural Indians have no plumbing and answer nature\'s call by squatting in the forest. Most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey, and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow, as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge. And so, a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation. It is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead. But these efforts, along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign, seem to be paying off. The latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in India, a 30% increase over the previous count in 2011. If the estimates hold, this would make India the only country in the world with a growing tiger population. But the human population is growing much faster. Maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation. You\'ll be surprised by the others as we seek India\'s magnificent treasures -- both natural and man-made -- on the next episode of ""The Wonder List.""']","The latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in India, a 30% increase over the previous count in 2011.

"What is the term for the time it takes Iran to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, and how does the number of centrifuges affect this ""break-out time""?","['Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)Nuclear talks intensified Sunday between world powers and Iran, but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb Tehran\'s nuclear program ahead of a Tuesday deadline. As the negotiations entered their fourth day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than Israel\'s deepest fears. The talks had hit a snag on Saturday, with diplomats describing Iran as refusing to budge, but as the French, German and Chinese foreign ministers arrived, the mood seemed more optimistic. The British and Russian foreign ministers were expected late Sunday. U.S. officials and Western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense, which was expected as the talks reached the endgame. They said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer, but they were unsure it could be reached. Two core issues are still unresolved: 1) Limits on Iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal; and 2) The pace of lifting United Nations sanctions. The U.S. officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to, comparing the final deal to a puzzle. But they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome. The speed of which U.N. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute. Iran wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect. While diplomats say Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran\'s nuclear program does not have a military dimension. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block, saying he believes the world powers ""have realized that sanctions, pressure and an agreement will not go together. It\'s only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating."" U.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. Those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, with others being relaxed over the next five. ""We will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed,"" a Western diplomat said. ""We are not asking them to do nothing, but they want to do more than we want them to do"" referring to how much research the Iranians want to be able to still undertake. But the diplomat added, ""after 15 years, they can do what they want."" A senior Iranian diplomat told CNN on Sunday: ""It\'s not fair to characterize the state of affairs as Iranian resistance on those issues. It can also be characterized as the other side\'s intransigence in the talks."" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium, a process that can lead to weapons-grade material.  The figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted.  Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is abstract, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the ""break-out time""  -- to at least a year. On Monday, a senior State Department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material. There had been word previously that Iran might export it to Russia, but an Iranian negotiator, Abbas Araqchi, told journalists Sunday that Iran had not agreed to it. ""The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,"" he said. Netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal. After meeting with visiting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, Netanyahu said, ""this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse."" ""In parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement, the proxies of Iran in the Middle East are carrying out a wide occupation of Yemen,"" he said. ""The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped."" The parties are seeking agreement on the']","The term for the time it takes Iran to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon is known as the ""break-out time.""

"What does ""Gift Horse"" by Hans Haacke say about art and commerce, considering its historical references and location in Trafalgar Square?","['(CNN)From an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel, London\'s Fourth Plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around London\'s Trafalgar Square. The latest offering, ""Gift Horse,"" which took up residence in the Square\'s northwest corner Thursday, looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power, money and history, according to organizers. Unveiled by London\'s Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London\'s Stock Exchange. ""\'Gift Horse\' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth,"" Johnson said. The 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a ""wry comment,"" organizers say, on the equestrian statue of King William IV originally planned, but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago. Further nods to the past and the sculpture\'s location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving ""The Anatomy of a Horse"" by English artist George Stubbs, whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square\'s north side. One of London\'s most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. In a career spanning half-a-century, Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text. Many of Haacke\'s most famous works have explored systems, be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work ""Condensation Cube"" -- or the social and political as seen in ""MoMA Poll"" (1970), ""A Breed Apart"" (1978) and more recently his ""Der Bevölkerung"" (The People) installed in Germany\'s Reichstag building in Berlin in 2000. ""It\'s a very prominent spot,"" said the 78-year-old, reflecting on the ""Gift Horse\'s"" positioning in Trafalgar Square,  ""It\'s very beautiful. Everybody sees it."" ""There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea,"" added Haacke. Around Trafalgar Square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture. ""It definitely doesn\'t look like a horse\'s head, does it? Looks more dinosaur-ish to me,"" said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from Wales, while another tourist seemed equally confused. ""My first impression was that it looked like an alien, because you see it and then you think, huh? What is it?"" said Toni, visiting from Switzerland. Local reaction was more positive though. ""I just think it\'s very witty,"" said Londoner Tony Francis. ""I can see the (George) Stubbs influence. And I love the Stock Exchange (ribbon) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other."" ""Gift Horse"" is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the ""Hahn/Cock,"" created by German artist Katharina Fritsch which was in residence from July 2013 to February this year.']","'Gift Horse' by Hans Haacke is a comment on the relationship between art and commerce.

What was Simone Gbagbo's role in the crimes against humanity in Ivory Coast and its relation to the 2010 post-election violence?,"['(CNN)A court in Ivory Coast has sentenced former first lady Simone Gbagbo to 20 years in prison, the official AIP news agency said. Gbagbo was convicted Monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based International Criminal Court awaiting trial over similar charges. The charges stem from the aftermath of Gbagbo\'s husband\'s election defeat in 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. In 2012, the ICC issued a warrant against her, alleging that as a member of the president\'s inner circle, his wife was an ""indirect co-perpetrator."" She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant. Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. Both have denied the charges. But Ivory Coast refused to transfer Simone Gbago, saying it would try her in a domestic court instead. On Monday, it did.
